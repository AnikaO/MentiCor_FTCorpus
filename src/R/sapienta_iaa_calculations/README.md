The source code in this folder has been provided by Prof. Maria Liakata
(m.liakata at warwick dot ac dot uk) and was initially developed for the study
published in
http://www.sapientaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LREC2016_Ravenscroft.pdf. The
obtained code was modified as part of this project to add
documentation and simultaneous computation of the five different
Inter-annotator agreement measures. The scripts can now also be called
with configuration parameters for easier handling.
