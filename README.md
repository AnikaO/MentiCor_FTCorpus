# MentiCor: a full text corpus for Dementia

An automatic alignment of the published scientific literature and electronic health records relies on tools that can reliably analyse text information. In order to develop these tools, resources (so called corpora or gold standards) are needed that allow the targeted a development and constant improvement. This project aimed to build a gold standard of the published scientific literature on Dementia using entities and structure information. 

The entities of interest for this project have been defined in accordance with an electronic health record system, which facilitates integration at later stages. The types of entities are: age, age groups, gender, and/or ethnicity of study participants; phenotypes; diseases; medications; treatments (other than medication, e.g. music therapy); measures (scale minima and maxima where accessible) and demographic information. We developed an initial set of annotation guidelines that can be accessed here (-- add link!). [Brat](http://brat.nlplab.org/) was configured for the purpose of easily adding text annotations.

Structure information relates to the discourse of a scientific paper and we followed here the Core Scientific Concept (CoreSC) annotation scheme as defined by [Liakata and Soldatova](http://repository.jisc.ac.uk/88/). We followed the latest version of the annotation guidelines as applied in [Ravenscroft et al.](http://www.sapientaproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/LREC2016_Ravenscroft.pdf), in which a sentence can be annotated with up to three CoreSC annotations. The [Sapient annotation interface](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1572391) is readily available [online](http://www.sapientaproject.com/software#sapienta_soft) and can be configured for server use.

[Figure 1](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1aNSfn4fL4q-0Rswkm1-Fdi6Ou-MNoH1vCVQ1ZPjC1Vw/edit?usp=sharing) details the workflow of set-up of the annotation task. We contracted three curators to annotate 50 papers from six different journals with both entity and structure annotations. Based on the inter-annotator agreement results and some stringent rules, we merged individual annotations into one gold standard, incorporating entity and structure information.
